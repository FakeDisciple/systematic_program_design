# Systematic Program Design
My notes, workings and coursework for [EDX course Systematic Program Design.](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015/home)

## Syllabus
- SPD course consists of 3 parts with 1 or 2 modules.
- Description of the module learning goals and summary of the work required.
- Blended topic lectures which consist of video interspersed with question to answer.
- Problems to practice the new design techniques.
- A module quiz that involves self-assesed design problem.
- Each part of of the course has a small project in the form of a larger design quiz that uses peer assesment.
- Module wrap up.

## Grading
1. Lecture Questions: 35%

    During the lecture videos there will be questions to answer to reinforce the understanding of taught topic material. 
2. Design Quizzes: 35%

    Part 2 & 3 will contain quizzes which will be based on the topic taught. The quizzes will be self-assessed based on rubic and assessment videos. 
3. Final Project: 30%
    The final project will be based on everything learned. It will be peer-assessed based on rubic and assessment. 

## Guide to doing well
- Learn by doing: 
  - Watch the videos actively and type along with the lecture also experiment with what is being taught.
  - As you learning create error. 
  - Rework the lecture problem on your own. 
    - First try without the lecture notes or videos, if you don't understand view notes first then watch the lecture videos again.
  - Do t
