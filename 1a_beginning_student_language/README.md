# Notes on 1a Beginninng Student Language

## Module Overview
During this course the material will be taught in a programming languase called Beginning Student Language(BSL) it has been specifically design to be small simple, most of the language features can be learned in the first module. 

The simplicity creates the benifit of learning desing methods. BSL forms the core of nearly every other language that can be used through the life of a programmer. Using BSL means the design methods can be used on other programming languages.
**AVOID SKIMMING THROUGH THE MODULE.**
While BSL contains core of other programming languages it is different in important ways. Take your time to learn the material. 
### Learning Goals
- Write expressions that operate on primitive data which includes numbers, strings, images and booleans.
- Write constants and function definitions.
- Write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressionns which includes function calls.
- Use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluations of an expression.
- Use Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.


## Expressions
### Terms used:
- **Expression:** element of a program that is evaluated to produce a value.
- **Value:** data element such as 1(int), "foo"(stringn), (make-cat 10 20)(list)
- **Evaluate:** program executionns proceeds by evaluating expressionns to produce values.
- **Operator:** primitive operators are provided by language to operate on primitive data, this includes *,-,+, string-append, substring, image-width and many more.
- **Primitive:** Basic building block that is used to design a program. BSL containns primitive data and primitive operations.
- **Comment:** Comments is ignored bby BSL and it used to communicate to human reader something important or description of the program. A comment in BSL is create via ; and text followingn the ;.
- **Operand:** expressionn following the function name is a function call expression or operator name in a primitive call expression are called operands.
- **Argument:** value passed to a function or primitive operation when it is called. The arguments are values that result from evaluatinng the operands in the funnction or primitive call.  
- **Number:** primitive data that represent any number which include whole number, 0, fractions and decimals.
